This package introduces middleware functions standardization for more elastic approach to development and feature delivery.

## Function schema

This example shows all props that are provided for your usage.

```ts title="_middleware.ts"
async ({ request, response, context, event, forward, params }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
  // function body
}
```

## Explanation

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`request`

Type: [NextRequest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/functions/next-request)

That's a user middleware's request passed to function, which cookies (and only them) can be later **updated** by **forwarded** functions in chain.

This props cookies will only deffer from the original user's request if you've forwarded any response it in the chain.

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`response`

Type: [NextResponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) | `undefined`

This property contains (optional) resposne object that were forwarded in prev middleware function using `forward()` function.

<Card href="/docs/forward-functions" title="Forward functions" description="Learn more about Forward functions in middleware" icon={<ArrowRightIcon/>}/>

It can be used for example for checking custom headers from external packages middlewares output that was forwarded in chain.

```ts title="_middleware.ts"
async ({ response }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
  if (response) {
    console.log(response.headers.get('x-custom-header'));
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  If forwarded middleware added any custom headers or cookies, they will be passed to user at the end of the chain no matter if you handled that.
</Callout>

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`context`

Type: [Map\<string, unknown\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)

This property contains context shared across whole execution chain for every function.

<Card href="/docs/context" title="Shared context" description="Learn more about Shared Context in middleware" icon={<WaypointsIcon/>}/>

<Callout>
  If you want to know more about Map interface usage please refer to these [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).
</Callout>

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`event`

Type: [NextFetchEvent](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)

This property contains event object for serverless functions execution.

<Callout>
  It can be used to use Next.js 15 new features like ` event.waitUntil()`.

  You can read more there: [Next.js 15 waitUntil](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)
</Callout>

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`forward`

Type: `(response: MiddlewareReturn) => void`

The `forward` function allows you to forward the response from one middleware function to another. This can be useful for chaining middleware functions together and creating more complex middleware logic.

<Card href="/docs/forward-functions" title="Forward functions" description="Learn more about Forward functions in middleware" icon={<ArrowRightIcon/>}/>

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`params`

Type: `() => Partial<Record<string, string | string[]>>`

This property contains route parameters parsed from the URL path. Just like it's working in Next.js pages/routes/layouts but without awaiting.

```ts title="_middleware.ts"
// Example URL: /team/123
// Matcher: '/team/:slug'

async ({ params }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
  console.log(params().slug); // Output: 123
}
```
