This package uses [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/component/path-to-regexp) package to match the middleware routes path and parse the route params in a same way as Next.js does in config's matcher prop.

## Examples

To make it easier to understand, you can check the below examples:


### Simple route

Matches `/dashboard` route and returns no params.

```plaintext title="Simple route"
/dashboard
```

### Prams

General structure of the params is `:paramName` where `paramName` is the name of the param that will be returned in the middleware function.

#### Single

Matches `/dashboard/anything` route and returns `team` param with `anything value`.

```plaintext title="Single"
/dashboard/:team
```

You can also define segments in the middle of URL with is matching `/team/anything/dashboard` and returns `team` param with `anything` value.

```plaintext title="Single with suffix"
/dashboard/:team/delete
```

#### Optional

Matches `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/anything` routes and returns `team` param with `anything` value if there is value provided in url.

```plaintext title="Optional"
/dashboard{/:team}
```

```plaintext title="Optional wildcard"
/dashboard{/*team}
```

#### Wildcard

Matches `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/anything/test` routes and returns `team` param with `[anything, test]` value if there is value provided in url.

```plaintext title="Wildcard"
/dashboard/*team
```
