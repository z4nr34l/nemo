The `createMiddleware` function is the main entry point for the Next Easy Middlewares package. It allows you to create a middleware helper that can be used to define middleware functions for your Next.js application.

## Configuration

This is our basic construction which we will use to create a middleware helper.

```ts title="middleware.ts"
const middlewares = {
  '/api': async ({ request }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
    // middleware functions for /api route
  },
};

const globalMiddlewares = {
  before: async () => {
    // global middleware function that will be executed before any route middleware
  },
  after: async () => {
    // global middleware function that will be executed after any route middleware
  }
}

export const middleware = createMiddleware(middlewares, globalMiddlewares);
```

## Path middlewares construction (`middlewares`)

**Type**: [`Record<string, MiddlewareFunction | MiddlewareFunction[]>`](/docs/functions)

This property contains a map of middleware functions that will be executed for specific routes. The key is the route path, and the value is the middleware function.

Let's break down the construction:

### Matcher

**Type**: `string` (`middlewares` object key)

In this library is used [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp) package to match the middleware routes path in a same way as Next.js does in config's matcher prop.

<Tabs items={["Simple", "Route segments"]}>
  <Tab value="Simple">
    ```ts title="middleware.ts"
    const middlewares = {
      '/api': // middleware functions for /api route // [!code focus]
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Route segments">
    ```ts title="middleware.ts"
    const middlewares = {
      '/team/:slug{/*path}': // middleware functions for /team/<slug>* route // [!code focus]
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
  This library uses latest version of `path-to-regexp` due to DoS vulnerability in previous versions that Next.js uses. Please refer to [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp?tab=readme-ov-file#errors) for current regex support information.
</Callout>

### Middleware function

**Type**: [`MiddlewareFunction | MiddlewareFunction[]`](/docs/functions)

This is a function that will be executed for the specific route. It can be a single function or an array of functions that will be executed in order.

<Tabs items={["Single function", "Chained functions"]}>
  <Tab value="Single function">
    ```ts title="middleware.ts"
    const middlewares = {
      '/api': async ({ request }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
        // middleware functions for /api route
      },
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Chained functions">
    ```ts title="middleware.ts"
    const middlewares = {
      '/api': [
        async ({ request, context }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
          // middleware functions for /api route
        },
        async ({ request, context }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
          // middleware functions for /api route
        }
      ]
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Global middlewares construction (`globalMiddlewares`)

**Type**: [`Record<"before" | "after", MiddlewareFunction | MiddlewareFunction[]>`](/docs/functions)

This property contains global middleware functions that will be executed before and after any route middleware.

### Before

**Type**: [`MiddlewareFunction | MiddlewareFunction[]`](/docs/functions)

This is a global middleware function(s) that will be executed before any route middleware.

### After

**Type**: [`MiddlewareFunction | MiddlewareFunction[]`](/docs/functions)

This is a global middleware function(s) that will be executed after any route middleware.

      },
    };

        async ({ request, context }: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
          // middleware functions for /api route
        }
      ]
