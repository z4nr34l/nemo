## Schema & Standardization

This package introduces middleware functions standardization for more elastic approach to development and feature delivery.

### Function schema

This example shows all props that are provided for your usage.

```ts title="Function definition"
import {type MiddlewareFunctionProps} from "next-easy-middlewares";

async ({request, response, context, event}: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
  return response
}
```

<Callout>
  Every function should return an response object (pass from props or return custom).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Response object should be compatible with [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) or [NextResponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) interface
</Callout>

#### Types

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./types/index.d.ts",
  "name": "MiddlewareFunctionProps"
}
```

### Explanation

#### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`request`

Type: [NextRequest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request)

That's a user middleware's request passed to function, which can be later **updated** by functions in chain.

For example in case of authorization processes or custom headers/cookies management this prop can differ from its entry form.

#### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`response`

Type: [NextResponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response)

This property contains `NextResponse.next()` (only for first executed function in chain), which can be **updated** by other functions in chain.

#### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`context`

Type: [Map\<string, unknown\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)

This property contains context shared across whole execution chain for every function.

<Callout>
  If you want to know more about Map interface usage please refer to these [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).
</Callout>

#### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`event`

Type: [NextFetchEvent](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)

This property contains event object for serverless functions execution.

<Callout>
  It can be used to use Next.js 15 new features like ` event.waitUntil()`.

  You can read more there: [Next.js 15 waitUntil](https://rc.nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)
</Callout>
