NEMO uses Next.js native middleware function schema to provide you with a familiar way of writing middleware functions and enabling you to use 3rd party packages without any issues.

## Function schema

NEMO middleware function API is fully compatible with Next.js native API. It's just extending the event prop with some additional props and functions.

```ts twoslash title="_middleware.ts"
import { NextMiddleware } from "@rescale/nemo";

const example: NextMiddleware = async (request, event) => {
  // function body
};

```

#### Info

You can check detailed types by hovering on function parts and props.

## Explanation

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`request`

Type: [NextRequest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/functions/next-request)

That's a user middleware's request passed to middleware and can be later **updated** by functions in chain.

This props cookies will only deffer from the original user's request if you've forwarded any response it in the chain.

### Prop:&nbsp;&nbsp;`event`

Type: `NemoEvent` extends [NextFetchEvent](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)

This property contains event object for serverless functions execution extended via `nemo` prop which contains chain execution storage.

#### Logger methods

The event object includes built-in logging capabilities that use the same logger as NEMO internally:

```ts
// Debug logging (only displayed when debug is enabled in config)
event.log("Processing user request", userId);

// Error logging (always displayed)
event.error("Failed to process request", error);

// Warning logging (always displayed)
event.warn("Deprecated feature used", featureName);
```

These logger methods maintain the "[NEMO]" prefix for consistent logging throughout your middleware chain.
